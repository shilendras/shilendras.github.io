	<h2 align="margin-left">Vision</h2>

		<p>
        A future society that empowers all its individuals and 
        improves its ability to solve complex and interesting problems. 
        </p>
        
    <h2 align="margin-left">My interests</h2>

    <p>My current interests in exploring the vision is in 2 broad areas. </p>

    <h3 align="margin-left">1. Education</h3>

        <p align="right">
        "We cannot solve our problems with same level of thinking <br> 
        that we used to create them."<br>
		&mdash;Albert Einstein
        </p>
        
        <p align="right">
            "Educate and inform the whole mass of the people.<br> 
            They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty.‚Äù<br>
            &mdash;Thomas Jefferson
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the key component in creating such a future society I believe is Education. The two quotes
            emphasises the two important ideas of the vision. Namley of: 
            
            <ol>

                <li><b>Improving the ability to solve complex problems </b></li>
                <p>
                    It follows from Einstein's comment that, to solve complex problems of the future we
                    need to create future thinkers (and doers) who are better than that of the current generation. 
                    This I believe is one of the central role of education in any society. How do we go about creating 
                    an education system that creates better thinkers? This I believe is one of the most interesting
                    questions in exploring the vision of creating a future society. 
                </p>

                <li><b> Empowering the individual</b></li>
                <p>A much more educated society opens up the possibilities to design socio-political systems that
                   empowers the individual. For example, Democratic system in its true nature makes sense only if 
                   most of the population knows how to read and write. What systems can be build, that empowers the 
                   individual in a society more?. What should education do to enable the creation of such systems?. These 
                   are interesting questions I am interested in exploring.      
                </p>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h3 align="margin-left">2. Computing as a new medium</h3>

        <p> The invention of writing has had a huge impact on human socities. It has played a major 
            role in the inventions of new socio-political systems (constitutional democracy), new thinking tools
            (science) and so on. It has augmented the human intellect, allowing us to think thoughts that couldn't
            be thought before, and to create systems that couldn't be created before in an oral society. Till the 
            mid 19th century the most popular medium to represent the ideas of writing was "pencil and paper" medium.
            Now we have a new and exciting medium-- "Computing" or "dynamic medium" (as Bret Victor likes to call it). 
            This opens up a lot of interesting questions. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            The ones that I am most interested in exploring are the ones that aligns with my interests in education. 
            How can it help society think more powerful thoughts than what a "letter literate" society did?. What kind
            of new social systems does it enable? How can it help create an education system that creates better 
            thinkers?.
